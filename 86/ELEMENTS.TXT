About
=====
Elements is a puzzle game in which you must guide yourself to the exit before
you run out of energy. There are 7 boards with a total of 46 screens,
containing one-way arrows, keys, bonuses, traps and various switches.


How to Play
===========
At the title screen, press the 2ND key to play the selected board. Initially
you will only be able to play board 1.

At the start of board 1 you begin in the top-left corner (the white circle).
Use the arrow keys to move around. Notice that each time you move, you lose
some energy. You must complete the entire board (consisting of multiple
screens) without running out of energy. Exit each screen on the right-hand
side. Be aware that making mistakes on one screen can make the next screen
impossible.

The following is a description of all the objects you'll encounter:

cross           You must reach the cross to complete each board
battery         Boosts your energy
small box       Worth 50 points
arrow           You may only travel in the direction of the arrow
