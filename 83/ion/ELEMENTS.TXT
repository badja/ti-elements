How to Run
==========
Elements requires Ion to run.

To run Elements, make sure Ion is installed on your calculator. Send either
ELEMENTS.83P or ELEMENTS.8XP (for the 83 and 83+ respectively) to your
calculator and start Ion. Now you can run Elements.


About
=====
Elements is a puzzle game in which you must guide yourself to the exit before
you run out of energy. There are 7 boards with a total of 46 screens,
containing one-way arrows, keys, bonuses, traps and various switches.


How to Play
===========
At the title screen, press the 2ND key to play the selected board. Initially
you will only be able to play board 1.

At the start of board 1 you begin in the top-left corner (the white circle).
Use the arrow keys to move around. Notice that each time you move, you lose
some energy. You must complete the entire board (consisting of multiple
screens) without running out of energy. Exit each screen on the right-hand
side. Be aware that making mistakes on one screen can make the next screen
impossible.

The following is a description of all the objects you'll encounter:

cross           You must reach the cross to complete each board
battery         Boosts your energy
small box       Worth 50 points
arrow           You may only travel in the direction of the arrow
light/dark key  You may hold only one of each key at a time
light/dark lock Unlocks doors of the same color
light/dark door These are removed using a key with a lock

switch          Switches the directions of all arrows on current screen
round button    Inverts the color of all doors on current screen
square button   Fills all holes on current screen

You don't have to start on board 1 if you have reached a later board. You
can select which board to start on at the title screen, but your score will
start at zero.
